<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
<p>If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would it be?</p>

<p>If I could visit anywhere I would go to Seattle, WA. I would go there because of how rainy it is. I really thrive creatively in dim and depressing weather because it forces me to keep going despite everything around me.</p>



<h2>A person I admire (past or present).</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ralph Ellison</li>
    <p>I greatly admire Ralph Ellison because of how influential of a writer he was and continues to be even now. <br> I know for many people of color Ellison has stood as a beacon for many different walks of life and he is the same for me. <br> He never ceases to amaze through his literature.</p>
